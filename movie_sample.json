{"name": "Shadow in the Cloud", "plot": "Shadow in the Cloud is a 2020 World War II  action horror film directed by Roseanne Liang , from a screenplay by Liang and Max Landis , [4] starring Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz , Taylor John Smith , Nick Robinson , Beulah Koale , and Callan Mulvey . It follows a flight officer on a top-secret mission during the Second World War on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress while encountering an evil gremlin on board. The film premiered on September 12, 2020, at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival , where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness . [5] It was released on January 1, 2021, by Vertical Entertainment and Redbox Entertainment. In August 1943, Pilot Officer Maude Garrett, a female flight officer, is assigned to travel with a top secret package from Auckland , New Zealand, to Samoa . When she arrives at the airbase, she sees a ground crew ramp worker disappear, just before suddenly finding herself standing right in front of her transport, a B-17 bomber named The Fool's Errand . The bomber's crew gives her a mostly derisive welcome, and she is quartered in the Sperry Ball turret for the takeoff. With no room left for her document valise, she reluctantly allows the only crew member friendly to her, Staff Sergeant Walter Quaid, to store it. While stuck in the gun turret, Maude sees some sort of winged creature clinging to the underside of the bomber's wing. She reports it, but most of the crew, except Private Beckell, who also sees it, dismisses her. When she is allowed to leave the turret, the hatch malfunctions, trapping her inside. When she reacts indignantly to the crew's comments about her situation, they abandon their attempt to open the stuck hatch and the intercom suddenly goes dead. After seeing a Japanese aircraft appearing and disappearing in the clouds close to the bomber, she is abruptly attacked by the creature, a gremlin ; she fights it off but ends up being injured. When the crew contacts her again to ask what happened, a radio message comes in telling them that \"Maude Garrett\" doesn't exist and is not registered for their flight. When they begin to take her out for questioning, Maude deliberately jams the turret's gears and prepares to defend herself. Suddenly, the Japanese aircraft reappears and opens fire. Taking control of the gun turret, she shoots it down, winning the crew's grudging respect. While continuing to talk with the crew, Maude admits she is actually married and boarded the bomber under her maiden name, but refuses to reveal her mission, citing its secrecy . She sees the gremlin again as it continues to sabotage the bomber. Eventually, Private Dorn sights it too, but the others disregard him. Suspecting Maude's assignment is the cause of their misfortunes, Reeves gives the order to open the bag, which contains a baby, Maude's and Quaid's extramarital child . Forced to confess, Maude explains that she was severely mistreated by her husband; she had an affair with Quaid and inadvertently got pregnant. Someone betrayed her to her husband, who came to the base looking for her. Deciding not to tell Quaid, Maude faked her assignment to get away from her husband, who she says would have killed her in his rage. Just as Captain Reeves turns back to the airbase, three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters attack and the gremlin boards the bomber, injures Quaid, and kidnaps the baby. When the gremlin appears outside before her with the baby in the bag, Maude exits the turret and fires her handgun at it, driving it off; the bag is now hanging precariously from the engine nacelle. Risking a perilous climb under the wing, Maude is able to retrieve her child and reboard the bomber through the now shot away ball turret opening. The gremlin attacks again, throwing Technical Sergeant Taggart out of the aircraft before Maude can evict it. When Reeves, Lieutenant Finch, and Dorn are killed by additional Japanese fighter gunfire, Maude takes command and brings the bomber roughly but safely down in a controlled crashing landing. The gremlin reappears and tries to snatch the baby once again, but Maude is finally able to kill the creature, ending the threat. She and the other survivors watch as The Fool's Errand burns and explodes. In January 2019, it was announced that Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz had joined the cast, with Roseanne Liang directing from a screenplay by Max Landis . Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Fred Berger , Kelly McCormick and Tom Hern would serve as producers under their Automatik Entertainment and Four Knights Film banner, respectively. [6] In April 2019, Moretz announced the script had been rewritten several times following Landis's sexual assault allegations. [7] Landis was also removed as a producer, with Liang rewriting the film. Due to Writers Guild of America rules, Landis receives credit for the script. [8] [9] [10] That month, Nick Robinson joined the cast. [11]  During development, Liang turned to films with one character set in one location for inspiration, such as Aliens (1986) and Locke (2013). [12]  Principal photography began in June 2019 in Auckland , New Zealand . [13]  In a prologue to Shadow in the Cloud , an animated  training film from the United States Army Air Forces depicts the havoc a gremlin can produce for the unwary or complacent airman during wartime. When the film continues, the gremlin\u2014a metaphor for problems caused by inattention and/or negligence\u2014is depicted as a living, malevolent creature. [14] During the end credits, archival footage is shown of women serving in the British and American air forces in the Second World War . Shadow in the Cloud had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2020. [15] Shortly after, Vertical Entertainment and Redbox Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film. [16]  Shadow in the Cloud was released in the United States on January 1, 2021, although the release was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic . [17]  At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , 77% of 122 critics gave Shadow in the Cloud a positive review, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Part creature feature, part war movie, and part social commentary, Shadow in the Cloud doesn't always blend its ingredients evenly\u2014but it's frequently pulpy fun\". [18] According to Metacritic , which assigned Shadow in the Cloud a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 19 critics, having received \"generally favorable reviews\". [19]  Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com wrote that Shadow in the Cloud was \"a sincere but silly mash-up of WWII dogfights, gremlin chaos, and feminism in action\", and gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars. [20]  Shadow in the Cloud received a Grolsch People's Choice Award for Director Roseanne Liang in the \"Midnight Madness\" session in the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival. Liang also won the \"Director to Watch\" award at the 2021 Palm Springs International Film Festival . [21]"},

Stone is Australian, but was born in Basel and grew up in Cambridge and Melbourne. [1] His father, Stuart Stone, was a biochemist and his mother, Eleanor Mackie, a veterinary scientist. Stuart Stone died of a heart attack aged 45; Stone, aged 12, witnessed it, and has spoken about the ways in which that trauma has influenced his work. [2] [3]  In 2007 Stone founded the independent theatre company The Hayloft Project and adapted and directed their inaugural production of Frank Wedekind 's Fr\u00fchlings Erwachen . This production was remounted in 2008 at Belvoir St Theatre and was described in The Sydney Morning Herald as \"a lean, contained, ultimately furious, liberating production that is well-attuned to Wedekind's poetic rhythms, wit and pubescent discoveries.\" [4] Other productions Stone adapted and directed for The Hayloft Project include Platonov , 3xSisters , The Suicide and The Only Child , a new version of Henrik Ibsen 's Little Eyolf which won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Independent Production. [5]  In 2009 he directed Aleksei Arbuzov 's The Promise for Belvoir . In 2010 he directed and co-wrote with Mark Leonard Winter , Thomas Henning and Chris Ryan a version of Seneca 's Thyestes for The Hayloft Project and Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne . He directed The Cherry Orchard for Melbourne Theatre Company in 2013. [6]  In 2011 Stone became the Resident Director at Belvoir . In his first year in the role he wrote and directed The Wild Duck , after Henrik Ibsen , which has become his calling card production and has played internationally, including at the Holland Festival . Also in 2011 he also directed Robyn Nevin in Lally Katz 's Neighbourhood Watch for Belvoir and adapted and directed Bertolt Brecht 's Baal for the Sydney Theatre Company . [2] [7]  For Theater Basel , where he was a house director from 2015, he has directed Angels in America , John Gabriel Borkman , Three Sisters and the opera die tote Stadt . [8] A companion project with the works of August Strindberg , Hotel Strindberg , premiered at Theater Basel in 2018. [9]  For Ivo van Hove 's company Internationaal Theater Amsterdam , he has directed Medea in his own new adaptation, Husbands and Wives , Ibsen House , a new play by Stone which threads together the plots of several of Ibsen's plays in a new modern scenario, and Flight 49, inspired by the novel On Hoop van Zegen by Herman Heijermans. [10] [11]  In 2016, Stone premiered an adaptation of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca 's Yerma at the Young Vic in London . The production starred Billie Piper in the title role, [12] and was well reviewed, returning for a second run in 2017 before transferring to New York in 2018. [13] [14] It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Revival in 2017. Stone directed Luigi Cherubini 's opera version of Medea at the 2019 Salzburg Festival .

[16]  He directed the British drama film The Dig in 2021. [17] It focuses on an archeological dig in Sutton Hoo in 1939. Stone married Jessamy Dyer in 2004 [2] though the marriage ended in divorce. He has since married again. Stone likes to take pieces from the standard theatre canon which, with the help of his cast, he reworks into intimate, almost cinematic performances. He often works from improvisation creating an entirely new script through which the original play nevertheless shines. This practice is sometimes referred to as \"over-writing\". [18]  Stone believes in theatre as a place for polemic: \"One can't make theatre based on fear and compromises. Without argument, there is no art.\" [19]  Yet, at the same time, he acknowledges that his own art has its roots in finding a language for the trauma of his father's death. \"I certainly couldn't talk to people about what had happened to me. Especially at a young age, people are very confronted by 'how on earth do I even talk about that absurdly dark thing that happened to Simon?'. Of course, in cinema and literature, you find conversation partners. They're not talking back but they kind of are because they're telling you you're not the only person who's been through that thing.\" [20]  http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news-article/news/museums-and-libraries/career-profile-simon-stone-171896  http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/a-theatre-man-in-a-hurry-20110215-1augh.html  http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/theatre/stones-hit-and-myth-20100913-1597t.html  http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/theatre/features/9512/simon-stone  https://archive.today/20130204020748/http://www.thebrag.com/2011/02/14/interview-simon-stone-the-wild-duck/  http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/explorations-into-the-dark-side/story-e6frg8n6-1226031552593  https://web.archive.org/web/20130429075742/http://www.thebrag.com/2011/05/16/feature-baal/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1U8NLT0ZLQ"},
