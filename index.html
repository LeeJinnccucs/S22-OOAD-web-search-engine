Project description
Developing a user-friendly search engine from scratch. The search engine will focus on a specific domain of information to provide results confined to the knowledge space of that domain. 
 
The engine will serve through four primary functional units:
Crawling/Spider  - That will systematically browse the WWW to collect data for indexing.
Indexing - refers to collecting, parsing, and storing data for fast retrieval.
Searching - matching the user query to provide accurate results.
Fronted end - presenting the retrieved data in a convenient and accessible manner.


Functional Requirements:
Partial and Complete Keyword Search 
Pagination
Sorting Results (Most popular/ alphabetical order)
Autofill
Search based on boolean operations - AND|OR|NOT
Symbol filtering- ignoring specific characters in the search input
