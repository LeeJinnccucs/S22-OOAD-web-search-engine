# S22-OOAD-web-search-engine

##Project Description
Developing a user-friendly search engine from scratch. The search engine will focus on a specific domain of information to provide results confined to the knowledge space of that domain. 
 
The engine will serve through four primary functional units:
  1. Crawling/Spider  - That will systematically browse the WWW to collect data for   indexing.
  2. Indexing - refers to collecting, parsing, and storing data for fast retrieval.
  3. Searching - matching the user query to provide accurate results.
  4. Fronted end - presenting the retrieved data in a convenient and accessible manner.


##Functional Requirements:
  1. Partial and Complete Keyword Search 
  2. Pagination
  3. Sorting Results (Most popular/ alphabetical order)
  4. Autofill
  5. Search based on boolean operations - AND|OR|NOT
  6. Symbol filtering- ignoring specific characters in the search input
